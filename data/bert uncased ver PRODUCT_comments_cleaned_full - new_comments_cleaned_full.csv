Anyway, I've had this discussion countless times & as much as I'd like to engage you in this wonderful discussion, at this precise moment, I find myself a little tired. So please accept the following text, which I'm copying and pasting here from one of my previous back and forth discussions on youtube comments. I'm disclosing this in case you ever encounter it elsewhere. But it addresses precisely what you're talking about, I say what I say from experience, having extensively made an enormous collection of AI generated art and from interacting and appreciating other artists' works, its out of respect of your opinion (for I once held the same thought) that I'd like you to read the following so that maybe you might understand the implications of AI generated Art in the context of Artistic merit, its long, but I hope you'll read it: 

In the realm of art, there exists a spectrum of sophistication. On one end, there are those who provide generic instructions such as ""Cat with a hat at the Beach,"" resulting in creations that fall short of established artists and animators. However, at the other end of the spectrum, we encounter highly skilled digital artists who have elevated prompt engineering to an art form worthy of awe. These creators infuse their AI-assisted designs with the essence of their own minds and the passion of their souls. These outputs truly stand out amidst the sea of uninspiring AI-generated works. They deserve our admiration, and their efforts epitomize the essence of true artists.

Just as anyone can wield a pencil and paper without skill, they may be categorised as amateurs in the world of art. Similarly, in the intersection of art and AI, there are amateurs and there proficient practitioners, commanding deep knowledge of prompt guidance and complex instructions crafting genuinely original creations that can't be duplicated It's essential to remember that when discussing AI-generated art, the ultimate genesis lies within the human mind, as these creations wouldn't exist without human initiative.

Uniqueness is another facet of this fascinating landscape. No two adept digital artists envision the same artwork. Some individuals, not well-versed in traditional painting or drawing, harness the human imagination to conceive initial drafts, which they subsequently reverse engineer into a prompt or modify using AI. Others blend various AI-generated elements to craft entirely new artistic pieces, akin to the methods employed by notable pop artists like Andy Warhol and Roy Fox Lichtenstein. Are we to assert that their works lack artistic merit? I firmly believe that their creations merit all the respect one can give to a formidable artist.

These common prompts everyone is now familiar with, such as the one you've described, ""teddy bear sitting in the..."" are the entry level. Think of them like colouring books for children. It's a starting point accessible to everyone, then for those who truly are interested, there's a deeper and expansive world to explore, just as with any interest we discover deeper layers the further we progress in our development. There's more to this than just one-liner prompts. There's a world that intermingles prose, descriptive writing, and technical digital illustrative skills. These are domains that recruit immense mental creativity. Creativity isn't dead. It's found a new outlet.

This territory is novel, and given sufficient time for the field to mature, I hold a confident outlook that artworks collaboratively generated by humans in conjunction with AI image generators, along with the emergence of more advanced AI tools, will undoubtedly earn their place within the annals of art.

What a tremendous problem you have created for us, the users of the Generative Workspace in Photoshop Beta. I have been working intensively since November 2024, and I have accumulated over a thousand images — each carefully crafted with prompts, composition references, style guidelines, and more. And now, without warning, you’ve decided to discontinue this essential feature and redirect us to Firefly Web?

To make matters worse, our entire work history is being deleted, and we’re given a deadline to download everything. Sure, we can retrieve the images, but what about the prompts we used? What about the reference images — those small yet meaningful thumbnails that helped us remember which inspirations corresponded to each file? 

Firefly only accepts Photoshop Web version for post edition. I rather to use the professional version in my Mac!

I have been using Photoshop since its very first version. Never before have I witnessed such a disheartening and disruptive decision. I have fiercely defended Photoshop and Adobe over the years, even when colleagues suggested I switch to other technologies. Now, I’m left questioning everything.
